# E-Commerce Example Page

This project was my first time taking a mockup and building out an entire page from start to finish.  I used a design found on Dribbble.com (https://dribbble.com/shots/3908696-Stile-Theme-Products/attachments/890096), inspired by Coding Phase to find something and just build it.  
  
 ## Approach
My workflow involves breaking down the mockup by sections from top to bottom, then building out each section one by one.  I setup the HTML along with any CSS classes needed, following BEM methodology for class naming.  After the HTML is setup, I'll setup a SCSS partial for the section.  After the desktop version is finished, I work my way backwards to apply media queries and adjust everything for mobile/tablet.

The layout was mostly build with Flexbox, but I incorporated CSS Grid on the related products section to make it responsive on mobile.  CSS Grid is definitely something I'll be exploring more of.
